## Project Overview

A Hacker News clone (with night mode!) using Rect as the framework and Redux for the state management. I used AJAX to make the API request to load the stories.
Learning how to use Redux for the state management was difficult at first but I am able to see how powerful of a tool it is. Overall I learned a lot about 
Redux and the React-like way of doing state management. Here is a link to the
[Live Site](https://ykhade.github.io/hn-clone/).
